# QC Bridge Maya-Blender - updates
# --------------------------------
# Maya has nothing like Blender's extension repositories: no index, no add-on
# manager, no version awareness. A .mod file is a path pointer and nothing
# more. So the update mechanism is ours to write, and this is it - the same
# shape Blender's is, aimed at a manifest published on GitHub Pages beside the
# release zip. It is the mechanism QC Bake for Maya uses, copied rather than
# reinvented.
#
# The module is split so the decisions can be tested without a network, a
# filesystem or Maya:
#
#   parse_version / is_newer / validate_manifest / is_safe_url
#       pure, and where every rule about what is acceptable lives
#   check / download
#       network
#   stage / apply_update / rollback
#       filesystem
#
# Three rules the implementation holds to, because an updater that gets them
# wrong is worse than no updater at all:
#
#   * Nothing is ever applied without the artist asking for it. A tool that
#     replaces itself mid-shot is a tool nobody trusts again.
#   * HTTPS only, and the download is checked against the digest the manifest
#     declares. This code runs whatever it unpacks.
#   * The old version is kept until the new one is proven to import. Anything
#     that goes wrong puts the previous version back.
